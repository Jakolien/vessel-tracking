One live tracking experiment based on the eye opening post of http://www.digital-geography.com/vessel-tracking-the-python-way/
But instead of inserting it into a text file, feeding a postgreSQL database in order to 
log on a regular basis. It makes use of psycopg2 plus the regular web scraping tools.
